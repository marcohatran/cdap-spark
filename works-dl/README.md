# Works DL

The foundation of PredictiveWorks. deep learning support is Intel's <a href="https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/">BigDL</a> 
library. The scope of this library was standardized as plugins for Google CDAP data pipelines.

As a result, deep learning pipeline plugins can be seamlessly combined with all other plugins of **CDAP-Connect** 
and **CDAP-Spark**.

The current version of <b>Works DL</b> is actually part of the commercial portfolio of Dr. Krusche & Partner.
It is planned to open-source this library until mids of 2020.
