# 
This project aims to implement the vision of **Visual DL** - Code-free orchestration of data pipelines (or workflow) to respond to deep learning use cases.

>Do not reinvent the wheel again

**Works DL** is based on Intel's [Analytics Zoo](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo) and makes distributed deep learning available as [CDAP](https://cdap.io) data pipeline plugins. It leverages Apache Spark DataFrame & ML Pipeline support that ships with BigDL v0.10.0 for integration purposes.

Model building and prediction stages can be mixed with other plugins from **CDAP-Spark** plugin foundation.
