# Apache Ignite & Spark Streaming for Eclipse Ditto

Eclipse Ditto is a technology in the IoT implementing a software pattern called **digital twins**.
A digital twin is a virtual, cloud based, representation of his real world counterpart (real world 
Things, e.g. devices like sensors, smart heating, connected cars, smart grids, EV charging stations etc).

The technology mirrors potentially millions and billions of digital twins residing in the digital world with physical **Things**. This simplifies developing IoT solutions for software developers as they do not need to know how or where exactly the physical Things are connected.

With Ditto a thing can just be used as any other web service via its digital twin.
