# Business Predictions Maturity Model (BPMM)

[**Predictive Works.**](https://predictiveworks.eu) has been designed to facilitate the corporate adoption of Predictive Analytics for enterprises at any scale.

## Why?
The landscape of modern big data and scalable analytics solutions is complex and often opaque for many enterprises. The approch to give value to the continously increasing amout of data typically ends in a plethora of different technologies and solutions with little interoperability.

We want to share a business maturity model that supports companies to gain sustainable value from their data with a strong focus on *unification* & *standardization*. This model also builds the foundation for **Predictive Works.**

The BPMM is a practical guide with actionable recommendations based on (existing) open source solutions.

## Maturity Levels

The BPMM is the result of a long standing experience how many companies approach predictive analytics and defines 4 maturity levels:

### Level 1

At this level, corporate adoption of predictive analytics is guided by management terms such as "minimum viable product", "pilot project", "quick wins" and more. Such a situation usually indicates that no robust data (analytics) strategy exists. 

> Individual business sections launch hardly reusable software and data science projects which often *prove* fast that "something works".

The BPMM is guided by a completely different approach: The competitive advantage of predictive analytics is obvious. Therefore, the BPMM aims to support the fast adoption of a **production-ready** data analytics platform which covers all aspects of modern data processing, from data integration to query & rule based analysis up to machine and deep learning.

To put it on a more conceptual level (see Gartner's Analytics Continuum): The BPMM aims to cover following questions with a unified approach:

* What happended?
* Why did it happened?
* What will happen?
* How can we make it happen?

At the heart of each process that transforms data into valuable business insights and foresights is a single conceptual kernel:  a data workflow or pipeline. This concept is supported by almost all existing data solutions & engines. 

Solutions for complex event processing of real-time events, machine learning, deep learning and more all support the (programmatic) implementation of data pipelines, **but individually**.  

Companies located at this maturity level (and who have defined a data analytics strategy already) are challenged to implement data pipelines on top of these purpose-built solutions & engines to gain a production-ready 360Â° business view on their data. 

Symptoms, such as "trained machine learning models remain undeployable for prediction workflows", indicate that the implementation of these comprehensive data pipelines still fails. 

### Level 2

Companies at this maturity level understand that the adoption of (business-ready) predictive analytics does not start with the implementation of a certain prototype for demand prediction, e.g. in an Internet-of-Things context. 

They focus on the corporate adoption of a unified data pipeline solution that standardizes all aspects of data processing as pluggable and reusable stages. At this level, data integration use cases are mapped onto a set of pluggable data connectors, e.g. for SaaS applications. 

Complex event event processing is supported by pluggable business rule & query engines. And even model building and deployment is mapped onto a reusable pipeline plugins.

The BPMM recommends to leverage the comprehensive pipeline solution CDAP of former Cask Inc. Recently, this open source solution has been acquired by Google and put at the heart of their Cloud Data Fusion service. 

CDAP is also at the heart of [Predictive Works.](https://predictiveworks.eu)

Companies who are willing to follow the CDAP approach immediately benefit from a variety of pre-built data connectors that boost data integration use cases without the need to write code. In addition, companies gain a standardized technical environment to build their own reusable pipeline plugins. 

### Level 3

### Level 4
