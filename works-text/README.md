# Works Text

This project aims to implement the vision of **Visual NLP** - Code-free orchestration of data pipelines (or workflow) to respond to natural language processing use cases.

>Do not reinvent the wheel again

**Works Text** integrates [John Snow Lab's](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/) excellent **Spark NLP** library with [Google CDAP](https://cdap.io) and offers approved NLP features as plugins for CDAP data pipelines.
