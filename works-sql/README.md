# Works SQL

This CDAP pipeline stage supports the application of SQL queries to aggregate, group or filter incoming data records. **Works SQL** can be used with *batch* and *stream* processing. 

Suppose you decide to leverage Apacka Kafka as your streaming data connector and starting point of a real-time data pipeline, then *Works SQL* is an easy-to-use and powerful SQL engine for more complex event processing without the need to write code in a certain programming language.
